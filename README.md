## 📋 Project Overview
**GEOCAM PRO** is a feature-rich Flutter application designed for professionals who need accurate, data-rich site documentation. It captures high-quality photos with embedded GPS coordinates, timestamps, weather data, and compass direction, making it the ultimate tool for engineers, surveyors, and field reporters.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Field professionals often struggle with organizing site photos and ensuring data accuracy:
- Photos lack context (where and when were they taken?)
- Manual data entry for reports is time-consuming and prone to errors
- Existing apps are either too simple or overly expensive
- consolidating scattered media from different sites is a nightmare

## 💡 Solution
**GEOCAM PRO** solves these issues by providing:
- **Automatic Watermarking**: Instantly embeds GPS, date/time, and weather on photos.
- **Project-Based Organization**: photos are sorted by project and location automatically.
- **Map Integration**: View your photo locations on an interactive map.
- **Professional Reports**: Generate PDF reports and customized templates directly from the app.
- **Offline Capable**: Works perfectly in remote areas with poor connectivity.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The project follows a scalable feature-first architecture:

```
lib/
├── models/         # Data models for Projects, Photos, Settings
├── screens/        # UI Screens (Camera, Map, Gallery, Settings)
├── services/       # Core Logic (Camera, Location, Weather, Storage)
├── theme/          # App Styling and Branding
├── widgets/        # Reusable UI Components
└── main.dart       # Application Entry Point
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Maps**: `flutter_map`, `latlong2`
- **Location**: `geolocator`, `geocoding`
- **Camera**: `camera` package
- **Database**: `sqflite` for local persistent storage
- **Weather API**: Integrated via `http`
- **Ads**: Google Mobile Ads SDK
